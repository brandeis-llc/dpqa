  "A thorough understanding of adolescence in society depends on information from various perspectives, including psychology, biology, history, sociology, education, and anthropology. Within all of these perspectives, adolescence (adolescence)  is viewed as a transitional period between childhood and adulthood, whose cultural purpose is the preparation of children for adult roles. It (Puberty)  is a period of multiple transitions involving education, training, employment and unemployment, as well as transitions from one (one)  living circumstance to another. \n\nPuberty (Puberty)  occurs through a long process and begins with a surge in hormone production, which in turn causes a number of physical changes. It (Puberty)  is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of secondary sex characteristics (for example, a deeper voice and larger adam's apple in boys, and development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls s6 for example , a deeper voice and larger adam 's apple in boys , and development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls ) and a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state. This is triggered by the pituitary gland, which secretes a surge of hormonal agents into the blood stream, initiating a chain reaction to occur. The male and female gonads (The male and female gonads Patient)  are subsequently activated, which puts them (The male and female gonads)  into a state of rapid growth and development; the triggered gonads (The male and female gonads Patient)  now commence the mass production of the necessary chemicals. The testes primarily release testosterone, and the ovaries predominantly dispense estrogen (estrogen) . The production of these hormones (estrogen Theme)  increases gradually until sexual maturation is met. Some boys may develop gynecomastia due to an imbalance of sex hormones, tissue responsiveness or obesity.",

Geoffrey Nurberg, from Stanford University (Geoffrey Nurberg, from Stanford University) , agrees. \"People get better at writing by writing,\" he (Geoffrey Nurberg, from Stanford University Agent)  says. \"kids who are now doing text messaging, e-mails, and instant messages (kids who are now doing text messaging, e-mails, and instant messages Agent)  will write at least as well as, and possibly better than their (their pupils)  parents.\" Linguist James (James Agent)  says, for centuries (centuries) , it is believed without exception that young people are harming the language (the English language Patient) . And you can _ that when today's teenagers (today's teenagers Recipient)  become tomorrow (tomorrow) 's parents. They (languages Patient)  too will think this way. James (James Agent)  argues that languages (languages)  do not and cannot become corrupted. They (languages Patient)  simply change to meet the new needs.

  "Writing articles about films for The Front Page (The Front Page)  was my (my)  first (first)  proper job.

  "Parents might tell older children to \"Act (Act)  your age\". But some researchers say that (Act)  is what persons from thirteen to nineteen years old (thirteen to nineteen years old)  are doing. While teenagers (teenagers Stimulus)  can look all grown up, studies have shown that their (a group of young people)  brains are still developing (developing) . How much this (developing Theme)  explains their (a group of young people)  behavior, though, is a subject of debate. Jay Giedd of America's National Institutes of Health (Jay Giedd of America's National Institutes of Health)  is a leader in this area of research. Doctor Giedd (Jay Giedd of America's National Institutes of Health Agent)  has been studying a group of young people (a group of young people Topic)  since 1991 (1991) . They (a group of young people)  visit him (Jay Giedd of America's National Institutes of Health)  every two years (the teenage years)  for imaging tests of their (a group of young people)  brains. He (Mike Males Agent)  says considerable development continues in young people from the teenage years (the teenage years)  into the twenties. A part of the brain called the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex (A part of the brain called the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex)  appears especially undeveloped in teenagers. Researchers believe that this area (A part of the brain called the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex)  controls judgment and consideration of risk. So, its (A part of the brain called the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex)  underdevelopment may explain why young people seem more willing to take risks like driving too fast. Laurence Steinberg (Laurence Steinberg)  is a psychology professor at Temple University (Temple University)  in Philadelphia (Philadelphia) . He (Mike Males Agent)  says stronger laws and stronger parental control are needed to protect (protect)  teens (teens Agent)  from themselves (teens Topic) . That (protect)  includes raising the age for driving. He (Mike Males Agent)  says research shows that teenage brains are not fully equipped to control behavior. Other researchers, however, say there is not enough evidence to make a strong case for such findings. Psychologist Robert Epstein (Psychologist Robert Epstein Agent)  is a visiting scholar at the University of California (the University of California)  in San Diego (San Diego) . Mr. Epstein (Psychologist Robert Epstein Agent)  notes that teen behavior differs from culture to culture. He (Mike Males Agent)  says behavior depends for the most part on socialization.

But is that always true? Mike Males (Mike Males)  works at the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice (the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice)  in San Francisco (San Francisco) . He (Mike Males Agent)  suggests that all of this talk lately about brainless teens could be an attempt to take away attention from the reality. Writing in the New York Times (the New York Times) , he (Mike Males Agent)  says it is middle-aged adults whose behavior has worsened.

  "Wool is the textile fiber obtained from sheep and other animals, including cashmere and mohair from goats, qiviut from muskoxen (muskoxen) , angora from rabbits, and other types of wool from camelids. Wool (Wool)  mainly consists (consists)  of protein together with a few percent lipids. In this regard (consists)  it (Wool)  is chemically quite distinct from the more dominant textile, cotton, which is mainly cellulose. \n\nWool is produced by follicles which are small cells located in the skin (follicles which are small cells located in the skin) . These follicles (follicles which are small cells located in the skin Agent)  are located in the upper layer of the skin called the epidermis and push down into the second (second)  skin layer called the dermis as the wool fibers grow. Follicles can be classed as either primary or secondary follicles. Primary follicles produce three (three)  types of fiber: kemp, medullated fibers (the individual fibers Theme)  and true wool fibers. Secondary follicles only produce true wool fibers. Medullated fibers (the individual fibers Theme)  share nearly identical characteristics to hair and are long but lack crimp and elasticity. Kemp fibers are very coarse and shed out. Wool (Wool) 's scaling and crimp make it easier to spin the fleece by helping the individual fibers (the individual fibers Theme)  attach to each other, so they (wool fabrics)  stay together. Because of the crimp, wool fabrics (wool fabrics Pivot)  have greater bulk than other textiles, and they (wool fabrics)  hold air, which causes the fabric (Wool)  to retain heat. Wool (Wool)  has a high specific heat coefficient, so it (Wool)  impedes heat transfer in general.

The empire (cosmopolitan empire Patient)  grew rapidly under his (Genghis Khan, whom a council proclaimed ruler of all the Mongols in 1206)  rule and that of his (Genghis Khan, whom a council proclaimed ruler of all the Mongols in 1206)  descendants, who sent invasions in every direction.

A key reason for the split (split Verb)  was the dispute over whether the Mongol Empire (The Mongol Empire Theme)  would become a sedentary, cosmopolitan empire (cosmopolitan empire Patient) , or would stay true to their (The Mongol Empire Agent)  nomadic and steppe lifestyle. After M\u00f6ngke Khan (Kublai Khan)  died (1259 (1259 s10 1259 ) ), rival kurultai (kurultai)  councils simultaneously elected different successors, the brothers Ariq B\u00f6ke (Ariq B\u00f6ke)  and Kublai Khan (Kublai Khan) , who then not only fought each other in the Toluid Civil War (the Toluid Civil War s10 1260 \u2013 1264 )  (1260\u20131264 (1260\u20131264) ), but also dealt with challenges from descendants of other sons of Genghis (Genghis Khan, whom a council proclaimed ruler of all the Mongols in 1206) .

  "(CNN (CNN) ) -- The Supreme Court (The Supreme Court Destination)  has just agreed to take on the case of Fisher v.

Maybe. But equally likely is the possibility that racial double standards reinforce stereotypes about smart whites and even smarter Asians (Asians Theme) . There are certainly wide gaps in the average SAT (SAT)  scores between blacks and Hispanics (Hispanics) , on the one hand, and whites and Asians (Asians Theme) , on the other hand. \n\nAmong freshmen entering the University of Texas (University of Texas Destination)  in 2009 (2009)  who did not fall into the top 10% (10%)  of their high school class (automatic admission at the university (University of Texas s18 automatic admission at the university ) ), Asians (Asians Theme)  scored at the 93rd (93rd)  percentile of 2009 (2009)  SAT (SAT)  takers nationwide, whites at the 89th (89th)  percentile, Hispanics (Hispanics)  at the 80th (80th)  percentile and blacks at the 52nd (52nd)  percentile.

Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables (the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time)  in a given region. \n\nA region's climate is generated by the climate system, which has five (five)  components: atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere. \n\nThe climate of a location (a location)  is affected by its (a location)  latitude, terrain, and altitude, as well as nearby water bodies (nearby water bodies)  and their (nearby water bodies)  currents. Climates can be classified according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme was the K\u00f6ppen (K\u00f6ppen)  climate classification. The Thornthwaite (Thornthwaite)  system, in use since 1948 (1948 Agent) , incorporates evapotranspiration along with temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying biological diversity (biological diversity)  and how climate change affects it (biological diversity) . The Bergeron (Bergeron)  and Spatial Synoptic Classification (Spatial Synoptic Classification)  systems focus on the origin of air masses that define the climate of a region. \n\nPaleoclimatology is the study of ancient climates. Since direct observations of climate are not available before the 19th century (the 19th century) , paleoclimates are inferred from proxy variables that include non-biotic evidence such as sediments found in lake beds and ice cores, and biotic evidence such as tree rings and coral. Climate models are mathematical models of past, present and future climates. Climate change may occur over long and short timescales from a variety of factors; recent warming is discussed in global warming. Global warming results in redistributions.

  "A social class (social class Theme), as in class society, is a set of subjectively defined concepts in the social sciences and political theory centered on models of social stratification in which people are grouped into a set of hierarchical social categories, the most common being the upper, middle, and lower classes. \n\nClass (Class)  is a subject of analysis for sociologists, political scientists, anthropologists, and social historians. However, there is not a consensus on a definition of \"class\", and the term (Class Theme)  has a wide range of sometimes conflicting meanings. In common parlance, the term \"social class\" (Class)  is usually synonymous with \"socio-economic class\", defined as \"people having the same social, economic, cultural, political or educational status\", e.g., \"the working class\"; \"an emerging professional class\". However, academics distinguish social class (social class Theme)  and socioeconomic status (socioeconomic status Theme) , with the former (the proletariat, those who work but do not own the means of production Agent)  referring to one\u2019s relatively stable sociocultural background and the latter (socioeconomic status)  referring to one (one) \u2019s current social and economic situation and, consequently, being more changeable over time. \n\nThe precise measurements of what determines social class in society has varied over time. Karl Marx (Karl Marx Agent)  thought \"class\" was defined by one's relationship to the means of production (the proletariat, those who work but do not own the means of production Theme). His (Karl Marx Agent)  simple understanding of classes in modern capitalist society, are the proletariat, those who work but do not own the means of production (the proletariat, those who work but do not own the means of production Theme) ; and the bourgeoisie, those who invest and live off of the surplus generated by the former (the proletariat, those who work but do not own the means of production Agent) . This contrasts with the view of the sociologist Max Weber (Max Weber Agent) , who argued \"class\" is determined by economic position, in contrast to \"social status\" or \"\"Stand\"\" which is determined by social prestige rather than simply just relations of production.",

The company (Materialytics, in Killeen, Texas Agent)  is developing the technique (a technique that uses lasers to clarify these clues and identify a stone's homeland Stimulus) . \"With enough data, we (Materialytics, in Killeen, Texas Agent)  could identify which country, which mining place, even the individual mine a gemstone comes from,\" McManus (Catherine McManus Agent)  told Science News (Science News) . \n\nSome gemstones, including many diamonds (Some gemstones, including many diamonds Theme) , come from war-torn countries. Sales of those \"blood minerals (Some gemstones, including many diamonds) \" may encourage violent civil wars where innocent people are injured or killed. In an effort to reduce the trade in blood minerals, the U.S. (U.S.)  government passed law in July 2010 (July 2010)  that requires companies that sell gemstones (companies that sell gemstones Stimulus)  to determine the origins of their (companies that sell gemstones)  stones. \n\nTo figure out where gemstones come from, McManus (Catherine McManus Agent)  and her (Catherine McManus)  team (her team Agent)  focus a powerful laser (a powerful laser Agent)  on a small sample of the gemstone. The technique (a technique that uses lasers to clarify these clues and identify a stone's homeland Stimulus)  is called laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy. Just as heat can turn ice into water or water into steam, energy from the laser (a powerful laser Agent)  changes the state of matter of the stone. The laser (a powerful laser Agent)  changes a miniscule part of the gemstone into plasma, a gas state of matter in which tiny particles called electrons separate from atoms (plasma, a gas state of matter in which tiny particles called electrons separate from atoms) . \n\nThe plasma, which is superhot, (plasma, a gas state of matter in which tiny particles called electrons separate from atoms)  produces a light pattern. (The science of analyzing this kind of light pattern is called spectroscopy.) Different elements produce different patterns, but McManus (Catherine McManus Agent)  and her (Catherine McManus)  team (her team Agent)  say that gemstones from the same area produce similar patterns. Materialytics (Materialytics, in Killeen, Texas)  has already collected patterns from thousands (thousands)  of gemstones, including more than 200 (more than 200)  from diamonds. They (Materialytics, in Killeen, Texas Agent)  can compare the light pattern from an unknown gemstone (the light pattern from an unknown gemstone Patient)  to patterns they (Materialytics, in Killeen, Texas)  do know and look for a match. The light pattern (the light pattern from an unknown gemstone Agent)  acts like a signature, telling the researchers (Materialytics, in Killeen, Texas)  the origin of the gemstone. \n\nIn a small test, the laser technique (a technique that uses lasers to clarify these clues and identify a stone's homeland Stimulus)  correctly identified the origins of 95 (95)  out of every 100 (100)  diamonds. For gemstones like emeralds and rubies, the technique (a technique that uses lasers to clarify these clues and identify a stone's homeland Stimulus)  proved successful for 98 (98)  out of every 100 (100)  stones. The scientists (a team of scientists Agent)  need to collect and analyze more samples, including those from war-torn countries, before the tool (a technique that uses lasers to clarify these clues and identify a stone's homeland)  is ready for commercial use. \n\nScientists like Barbara Dutrow, a mineralogist from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge (Barbara Dutrow, a mineralogist from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge) , find the technique (a technique that uses lasers to clarify these clues and identify a stone's homeland Stimulus)  exciting. \"This (a technique that uses lasers to clarify these clues and identify a stone's homeland)  is a basic new tool that could provide a better fingerprint of a material from a particular locality,\" she (Barbara Dutrow, a mineralogist from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge)  told Science News (Science News) .",

  "(CNN)As art, film stills are often overlooked. \n\nThe photographers (The photographers Agent)  tend to be anonymous; it's easy to imagine their (The photographers)  work done by the director or cinematographer.

The new scientific discovery (a new study Theme)  came during a trip. \"We were travelling for fun. and one day I (Scott Taylor, a researcher in Florida)  kicked over a log and the fish (A fish that lives in America Theme)  came out,\" Taylor (Scott Taylor, a researcher in Florida Agent)  told reporters by telephone. He (Scott Taylor, a researcher in Florida Agent)  said he (Scott Taylor, a researcher in Florida)  would make his (Scott Taylor, a researcher in Florida)  study on the fish (A fish that lives in America Theme)  (a new study)  known to the public in an American (American)  magazine early next year (early next year Topic) . In lab tests, Taylor (Scott Taylor, a researcher in Florida Agent)  said he (Scott Taylor, a researcher in Florida)  found the fish (A fish that lives in America Theme)  can live up to 66 days out of water without eating. Some other fish can live out of water for a short period of time. The walking catfish found in Southeast Asia (Southeast Asia)  can stay on land for hours (hours)  at a time, while lungfish found in Australia (Australia) , Africa (Africa)  and South America (South America Theme)  can live out of water, but only in a not active way. But no other known fish can be out of water as long as the Mangrove Rivulus (A fish that lives in America)  and keep active, according to Patricia Wright, a biologist at a Canadian University (Patricia Wright, a biologist at a Canadian University) . More studies of the fish (A fish that lives in America Theme)  may tell how animals (animals Theme)  changed over time. \"These animals (animals Theme)  live in conditions similar to those millions of years ago (those millions of years ago) , when animals began to move from water onto land,\" Wright (Patricia Wright, a biologist at a Canadian University)  said.",
  "A new study (A new study Theme)  suggests that early exposure to germs strengthens (strengthens)  the immune system. That (strengthens)  means letting children (children)  get a little dirty might be good for their (people)  health later in life. \n\nThe study (A new study Theme)  involved laboratory mice (laboratory mice) . It (A new study)  found that adult mice raised in a germ-free environment (laboratory mice)  were more likely to develop allergies, asthma and other autoimmune disorders. There are more than eighty disorders where cells that normally defend the body instead attack tissues and organs (more than eighty disorders where cells that normally defend the body instead attack tissues and organs) . \n\nRichard Blumberg,who led the study (A new study Theme) ,is a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston,Massachusetts (Richard Blumberg,who led the study,is a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston,Massachusetts) . He (Rob Dunn Agent)  says,in 1989,medical (1989,medical)  researchers who sought to explain these diseases (more than eighty disorders where cells that normally defend the body instead attack tissues and organs Topic) , first (first)  discovered that the increasing use of antibacterial soaps and other products, especially early in life, could weaken immune systems. \n\nNow, Dr. Blumberg (Richard Blumberg,who led the study,is a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston,Massachusetts)  and his (Richard Blumberg,who led the study,is a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston,Massachusetts)  team have what is the first (first)  biological evidence to link early exposure to germs (early exposure to germs Topic)  to stronger adult immune systems. They (Richard Blumberg,who led the study,is a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston,Massachusetts Agent)  say this exposure (early exposure to germs)  could prevent the development of some autoimmune diseases. \n\nIn the adult germ-free mice (laboratory mice) , they (so-called killer T cells Agent)  found that inflammation in the lungs and colon was caused by so-called killer T cells (so-called killer T cells) . These (so-called killer T cells)  normally fight infection. But they (so-called killer T cells Agent)  became overactive and targeted healthy tissue--an autoimmune condition seen in asthma and a disease called ulcerative colitis . \n\nDr. Blumberg (Richard Blumberg,who led the study,is a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston,Massachusetts)  says the mice raised in a normal environment (laboratory mice)  did not have the same reaction. He (Rob Dunn Agent)  says their (people)  immune systems had been \"educated\" by early exposure to germs. \n\nRates of autoimmune disorders are rising worldwide, but mostly in wealthier, industrialized countries. According to Dr. Blumberg (Richard Blumberg,who led the study,is a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston,Massachusetts) , it might be high time that people (people)  were warned to be more careful with the early use of antibiotics and the prescription from their (people)  doctors. \n\nRob Dunn (Rob Dunn)  is a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at North Carolina State University (North Carolina State University)  in Raleigh (Raleigh) . He (Rob Dunn Agent)  says the new study (A new study Theme)  does not mean people should stop washing. \"Wash (Wash)  your hands , but don't do it (Wash)  with antibacterial soap. Let your kids play in a reasonable amount of dirt and get outside and get exposed to a diversity of things\", says Rob Dunn (Rob Dunn) .",

  "In modern molecular biology and genetics, the genome (the genome)  is the genetic material of an organism. It (the genome)  consists of DNA (organelles that contain their own DNA Result)  in RNA (RNA)  viruses). The genome (the genome)  includes both the genes and the non-coding sequences of the DNA/RNA. \n\nThe term (The term Result)  was created in 1920 (1920)  by Hans Winkler (Hans Winkler) , professor of botany at the University of Hamburg (the University of Hamburg) , Germany (Germany) . The Oxford Dictionary (Oxford Dictionary Agent)  suggests the name (The term)  to be a blend of the words gene and chromosome. However, see omics for a more thorough discussion. A few related -ome words already existed\u2014such as biome, rhizome, forming a vocabulary into which genome fits systematically. \n\nSome organisms have multiple copies of chromosomes: diploid (diploid) , triploid, tetraploid and so on. In classical genetics, in a sexually reproducing organism (typically eukarya) the gamete has half (half)  the number of chromosomes of the somatic cell and the genome is a full set of chromosomes in a diploid cell. The halving of the genetic material in gametes is accomplished by the segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. In haploid organisms, including cells of bacteria, archaea, and in organelles including mitochondria and chloroplasts, or viruses, that similarly contain genes, the single or set of circular or linear (linear)  chains of DNA (organelles that contain their own DNA Result)  for some viruses), likewise constitute the genome. The term genome can be applied specifically to mean what is stored on a complete set of nuclear DNA (organelles that contain their own DNA Result) but can also be applied to what is stored within organelles that contain their own DNA (organelles that contain their own DNA Result)  (organelles that contain their own DNA) , as with the \"mitochondrial genome\" or the \"chloroplast genome\". Additionally, the genome (the genome)  can comprise non-chromosomal genetic elements such as viruses, plasmids, and transposable elements.",
