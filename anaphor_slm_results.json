  "A thorough understanding of adolescence in society depends on information from various perspectives, including psychology, biology, history, sociology, education, and anthropology. Within all of these perspectives, adolescence (adolescence)  is viewed as a transitional period between childhood and adulthood, whose cultural purpose is the preparation of children for adult roles. It (adolescence)  is a period of multiple transitions involving education, training, employment and unemployment, as well as transitions from one (one)  living circumstance to another. \n\nPuberty (Puberty)  occurs through a long process and begins with a surge in hormone production, which in turn causes a number of physical changes. It (Puberty)  is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of secondary sex characteristics (for example, a deeper voice and larger adam's apple in boys, and development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls) and a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state. This is triggered by the pituitary gland, which secretes a surge of hormonal agents into the blood stream, initiating a chain reaction to occur. The male and female gonads (The male and female gonads)  are subsequently activated, which puts them (The male and female gonads)  into a state of rapid growth and development; the triggered gonads (The male and female gonads)  now commence the mass production of the necessary chemicals. The testes primarily release testosterone, and the ovaries predominantly dispense estrogen (estrogen) .

  "Endemism is the ecological state of a species being unique to a defined geographic location, such as an island, nation, country or other defined zone, or habitat type; organisms that are indigenous to a place (a place)  (organisms that are indigenous to a place)  are not endemic to it (a place)  if they (organisms that are indigenous to a place)  are also found elsewhere. The extreme opposite of endemism is cosmopolitan distribution. An alternative term for a species that is endemic is precinctive, which applies to species (and subspecific categories) that are restricted to a defined geographical area. \n\nThe word \"endemic\" is from New Latin (Latin)  \"end\u0113micus\", from Greek (Greek)  \u03b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, \"end\u0113mos\", \"native\". \"End\u0113mos (End\u0113mos) \" is formed of \"en\" meaning \"in\", and \"d\u0113mos\" meaning \"the people\". The term \"precinctive\" (The term \"precinctive\")  has been suggested by some scientists, and was first (first)  used in botany by MacCaughey (MacCaughey)  in 1917 (1917) . It (The term \"precinctive\")  is the equivalent of \"endemism\". \"Precinction\" was perhaps first (first)  used by Frank (Frank)  and McCoy (McCoy) . \"Precinctive\" seems to have been coined by David Sharp (David Sharp)  when describing the Hawaiian (Hawaiian)  fauna in 1900 (1900) : \"I (David Sharp)  use the word precinctive (The term \"precinctive\")  in the sense of 'confined to the area under discussion' ... 'precinctive forms' means those forms that are confined to the area specified.\" That definition excludes artificial confinement of examples by humans in far-off botanical gardens or zoological parks. \n\nPhysical, climatic, and biological factors can contribute to endemism. The orange-breasted sunbird (sunbird)  is exclusively found in the fynbos vegetation zone of southwestern South Africa (South Africa) . The glacier bear is found only in limited places in Southeast Alaska (Southeast Alaska) .

  "Parents might tell older children to \"Act (Act)  your age\". But some researchers say that (Act)  is what persons from thirteen to nineteen years old (thirteen to nineteen years old)  are doing.

How much this (developing)  explains their (teenagers)  behavior, though, is a subject of debate.

Researchers believe that this area (A part of the brain called the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex)  controls judgment and consideration of risk. So, its (A part of the brain called the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex)  underdevelopment may explain why young people seem more willing to take risks like driving too fast.

  "Wool is the textile fiber obtained from sheep and other animals, including cashmere and mohair from goats, qiviut from muskoxen (muskoxen) , angora from rabbits, and other types of wool from camelids. Wool (Wool)  mainly consists (consists)  of protein together with a few percent lipids. In this regard (consists)  it (Wool)  is chemically quite distinct from the more dominant textile, cotton, which is mainly cellulose. \n\nWool is produced by follicles which are small cells located in the skin (follicles which are small cells located in the skin) . These follicles (follicles which are small cells located in the skin)  are located in the upper layer of the skin called the epidermis and push down into the second (second)  skin layer called the dermis as the wool fibers grow. Follicles can be classed as either primary or secondary follicles. Primary follicles produce three (three)  types of fiber: kemp, medullated fibers (medullated fibers)  and true wool fibers. Secondary follicles only produce true wool fibers. Medullated fibers (medullated fibers)  share nearly identical characteristics to hair and are long but lack crimp and elasticity. Kemp fibers are very coarse and shed out. Wool (Wool) 's scaling and crimp make it easier to spin the fleece by helping the individual fibers (the individual fibers)  attach to each other, so they (the individual fibers)  stay together. Because of the crimp, wool fabrics (wool fabrics)  have greater bulk than other textiles, and they (wool fabrics)  hold air, which causes the fabric (Wool)  to retain heat. Wool (Wool)  has a high specific heat coefficient, so it (Wool)  impedes heat transfer in general.

  "(CNN (CNN) ) -- The Supreme Court (The Supreme Court)  has just agreed to take on the case of Fisher v. University of Texas (Fisher v. University of Texas)  (University of Texas)  (the case of Fisher v. University of Texas) . Abigail Fisher, a white woman, (Fisher v. University of Texas)  argues that she (Fisher v. University of Texas)  has been a victim of the university's (University of Texas)  race-conscious admission policies; the university (University of Texas)  contends that its (University of Texas)  drive for racial and ethnic diversity is educationally enriching -- a benefit to all students. \n\nWill the ugly discourse that generally characterizes debate over racially preferential policies disappear (disappear)  with the wave of a magic Supreme Court (The Supreme Court)  wand? It (disappear)  seems unlikely. The issue (The issue)  is a cat with many more than nine (more than nine)  lives. It (The issue)  arrived in the early 1970s (the early 1970s)  and, despite many attacks, some of which have taken the form of amendments to state constitutions, it (The issue)  has survived in pretty fine fettle. \n\nThe court (The Supreme Court)  will have only eight (only eight)  justices to hear the arguments. Elena Kagan, having been involved in the case (the case of Fisher v.

Her (Elena Kagan, having been involved in the case as solicitor general in the Obama administration,)  absence, however, leaves five (five)  justices likely to express at least some degree of skepticism about the racial preferences given to non-Asian (non-Asian)  minorities in the admissions process. \n\nHas the University of Texas (University of Texas)  been enriched by academic diversity? Maybe. But equally likely is the possibility that racial double standards reinforce stereotypes about smart whites and even smarter Asians (Asians) . There are certainly wide gaps in the average SAT (SAT)  scores between blacks and Hispanics (Hispanics) , on the one hand, and whites and Asians (Asians) , on the other hand. \n\nAmong freshmen entering the University of Texas (University of Texas)  in 2009 (2009)  who did not fall into the top 10% (10%)  of their high school class (automatic admission at the university (University of Texas) ), Asians (Asians)  scored at the 93rd (93rd)  percentile of 2009 (2009)  SAT (SAT)  takers nationwide, whites at the 89th (89th)  percentile, Hispanics (Hispanics)  at the 80th (80th)  percentile and blacks at the 52nd (52nd)  percentile. Startling? No. This picture has been well known for a long time. Heartbreaking, yes, because the numbers mean the underperforming minority students (the underperforming minority students)  are being woefully ill served by the K-12 (K-12)  school system.

  "Climate (Climate)  is the statistics of weather over long periods of time.

Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables (the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time)  in a given region. \n\nA region's climate is generated by the climate system, which has five (five)  components: atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere. \n\nThe climate of a location (a location)  is affected by its (a location)  latitude, terrain, and altitude, as well as nearby water bodies (nearby water bodies)  and their (nearby water bodies)  currents. Climates can be classified according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme was the K\u00f6ppen (K\u00f6ppen)  climate classification. The Thornthwaite (Thornthwaite)  system, in use since 1948 (1948) , incorporates evapotranspiration along with temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying biological diversity (biological diversity)  and how climate change affects it (biological diversity) . The Bergeron (Bergeron)  and Spatial Synoptic Classification (Spatial Synoptic Classification)  systems focus on the origin of air masses that define the climate of a region. \n\nPaleoclimatology is the study of ancient climates. Since direct observations of climate are not available before the 19th century (the 19th century) , paleoclimates are inferred from proxy variables that include non-biotic evidence such as sediments found in lake beds and ice cores, and biotic evidence such as tree rings and coral. Climate models are mathematical models of past, present and future climates. Climate change may occur over long and short timescales from a variety of factors; recent warming is discussed in global warming. Global warming results in redistributions. For example, \"a 3 (3) \u00b0C change in mean annual (annual)  temperature corresponds to a shift in isotherms of approximately 300\u2013400 km (approximately 300\u2013400 km)  in latitude (in the temperate zone) or 500 (500)  m in elevation. Therefore, species are expected to move upwards in elevation or towards the poles in latitude in response to shifting climate zones\".",
  "A gene is a locus (or region) of DNA that encodes a functional RNA (RNA)  or protein product, and is the molecular unit of heredity.:Glossary The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as the gene\u2013environment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye colour or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands (thousands)  of basic biochemical processes that comprise life. \n\nGenes (Genes)  can acquire mutations in their (Genes)  sequence, leading to different variants, known as alleles, in the population (different variants, known as alleles, in the population) . These alleles (different variants, known as alleles, in the population)  encode slightly different versions of a protein, which cause different phenotype traits. Colloquial usage of the term \"having a gene\" (e.g., \"good genes,\" \"hair colour gene\") typically refers to having a different allele of the gene. Genes evolve due to natural selection or survival of the fittest of the alleles.",

  "A social class (or, simply, class), as in class society, is a set of subjectively defined concepts in the social sciences and political theory centered on models of social stratification in which people are grouped into a set of hierarchical social categories, the most common being the upper, middle, and lower classes. \n\nClass (Class)  is a subject of analysis for sociologists, political scientists, anthropologists, and social historians. However, there is not a consensus on a definition of \"class\", and the term (Class)  has a wide range of sometimes conflicting meanings. In common parlance, the term \"social class\" (Class)  is usually synonymous with \"socio-economic class\", defined as \"people having the same social, economic, cultural, political or educational status\", e.g., \"the working class\"; \"an emerging professional class\". However, academics distinguish social class (social class)  and socioeconomic status (socioeconomic status) , with the former (social class)  referring to one\u2019s relatively stable sociocultural background and the latter (socioeconomic status)  referring to one (one) \u2019s current social and economic situation and, consequently, being more changeable over time. \n\nThe precise measurements of what determines social class in society has varied over time. Karl Marx (Karl Marx)  thought \"class\" was defined by one's relationship to the means of production (their relations of production). His (Karl Marx)  simple understanding of classes in modern capitalist society, are the proletariat, those who work but do not own the means of production (the proletariat, those who work but do not own the means of production) ; and the bourgeoisie, those who invest and live off of the surplus generated by the former (the proletariat, those who work but do not own the means of production) . This contrasts with the view of the sociologist Max Weber (Max Weber) , who argued \"class\" is determined by economic position, in contrast to \"social status\" or \"\"Stand\"\" which is determined by social prestige rather than simply just relations of production.",

  "Most people know precious gemstones (precious gemstones)  by their (precious gemstones)  appearances. An emerald flashes deep green, a ruby seems to hold a red fire inside, and a diamond (a diamond)  shines like a star. It's more difficult to tell where the gem (a diamond)  was mined, since a diamond from Australia (Australia)  or Arkansas (Arkansas)  may appear the same to one (one)  from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the Democratic Republic of the Congo) . However, recently, a team of scientists (a team of scientists)  has found a way to identify a gemstone's origin. \n\nBeneath the surface of a gemstone (a gemstone) , on the tiny level of atoms and molecules , lie clues to its (a gemstone)  origin (clues to its origin) . At this year (year) 's meeting of the Geological Society of America (the Geological Society of America)  in Minneapolis (Minneapolis) , Catherine McManus (Catherine McManus)  reported on a technique that uses lasers to clarify these clues (clues to its origin)  and identify a stone's homeland (a technique that uses lasers to clarify these clues and identify a stone's homeland) . McManus (Catherine McManus)  directs scientific research at Materialytics, in Killeen, Texas (Materialytics, in Killeen, Texas) . The company (Materialytics, in Killeen, Texas)  is developing the technique (a technique that uses lasers to clarify these clues and identify a stone's homeland) . \"With enough data, we (Materialytics, in Killeen, Texas)  could identify which country, which mining place, even the individual mine a gemstone comes from,\" McManus (Catherine McManus)  told Science News (Science News) . \n\nSome gemstones, including many diamonds (Some gemstones, including many diamonds) , come from war-torn countries. Sales of those \"blood minerals (Some gemstones, including many diamonds) \" may encourage violent civil wars where innocent people are injured or killed. In an effort to reduce the trade in blood minerals, the U.S. (U.S.)  government passed law in July 2010 (July 2010)  that requires companies that sell gemstones (companies that sell gemstones)  to determine the origins of their (companies that sell gemstones)  stones. \n\nTo figure out where gemstones come from, McManus (Catherine McManus)  and her (Catherine McManus)  team (her team)  focus a powerful laser (a powerful laser)  on a small sample of the gemstone. The technique (a technique that uses lasers to clarify these clues and identify a stone's homeland)  is called laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy. Just as heat can turn ice into water or water into steam, energy from the laser (a powerful laser)  changes the state of matter of the stone. The laser (a powerful laser)  changes a miniscule part of the gemstone into plasma, a gas state of matter in which tiny particles called electrons separate from atoms (plasma, a gas state of matter in which tiny particles called electrons separate from atoms) . \n\nThe plasma, which is superhot, (plasma, a gas state of matter in which tiny particles called electrons separate from atoms)  produces a light pattern. (The science of analyzing this kind of light pattern is called spectroscopy.) Different elements produce different patterns, but McManus (Catherine McManus)  and her (Catherine McManus)  team (her team)  say that gemstones from the same area produce similar patterns. Materialytics (Materialytics, in Killeen, Texas)  has already collected patterns from thousands (thousands)  of gemstones, including more than 200 (more than 200)  from diamonds. They (Materialytics, in Killeen, Texas)  can compare the light pattern from an unknown gemstone (the light pattern from an unknown gemstone)  to patterns they (Materialytics, in Killeen, Texas)  do know and look for a match. The light pattern (the light pattern from an unknown gemstone)  acts like a signature, telling the researchers (Materialytics, in Killeen, Texas)  the origin of the gemstone. \n\nIn a small test, the laser technique (a technique that uses lasers to clarify these clues and identify a stone's homeland)  correctly identified the origins of 95 (95)  out of every 100 (100)  diamonds. For gemstones like emeralds and rubies, the technique (a technique that uses lasers to clarify these clues and identify a stone's homeland)  proved successful for 98 (98)  out of every 100 (100)  stones. The scientists (a team of scientists)  need to collect and analyze more samples, including those from war-torn countries, before the tool (a technique that uses lasers to clarify these clues and identify a stone's homeland)  is ready for commercial use. \n\nScientists like Barbara Dutrow, a mineralogist from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge (Barbara Dutrow, a mineralogist from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge) , find the technique (a technique that uses lasers to clarify these clues and identify a stone's homeland)  exciting. \"This (a technique that uses lasers to clarify these clues and identify a stone's homeland)  is a basic new tool that could provide a better fingerprint of a material from a particular locality,\" she (Barbara Dutrow, a mineralogist from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge)  told Science News (Science News) .",

Risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet, and excessive alcohol intake, among others. The mechanism of an MI often involves the complete blockage of a coronary artery caused by a rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque. MIs are less commonly caused by coronary artery spasms, which may be due to cocaine, significant emotional stress, and extreme cold, among others. A number of tests are useful to help with diagnosis, including electrocardiograms (ECGs), blood tests, and coronary angiography. An ECG (ECG)  may confirm an ST (ST)  elevation MI if ST (ST)  elevation is present. Commonly used blood tests include troponin and less often creatine kinase MB (MB) .",

  "In modern molecular biology and genetics, the genome (the genome)  is the genetic material of an organism. It (the genome)  consists of DNA (or RNA (RNA)  in RNA (RNA)  viruses).

The Oxford Dictionary (Oxford Dictionary)  suggests the name (The term)  to be a blend of the words gene and chromosome. However, see omics for a more thorough discussion. A few related -ome words already existed\u2014such as biome, rhizome, forming a vocabulary into which genome fits systematically. \n\nSome organisms have multiple copies of chromosomes: diploid (diploid) , triploid, tetraploid and so on. In classical genetics, in a sexually reproducing organism (typically eukarya) the gamete has half (half)  the number of chromosomes of the somatic cell and the genome is a full set of chromosomes in a diploid cell. The halving of the genetic material in gametes is accomplished by the segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis.

  "A psychological identity relates to self-image (one's mental model of oneself), self-esteem, and individuality. Consequently, Weinreich (Weinreich)  gives the definition \"A person's identity (the definition \"A person's identity)  is defined as the totality of one's self-construal, in which how one (one)  construes oneself in the present expresses the continuity between how one (one)  construes oneself as one was in the past and how one (one)  construes oneself as one (one)  aspires to be in the future\"; this (the definition \"A person's identity)  allows for definitions of aspects of identity, such as: \"One's ethnic identity is defined as that part of the totality of one's self-construal made up of those dimensions that express the continuity between one's construal of past ancestry and one's future aspirations in relation to ethnicity\" (Weinreich, 1986a (Weinreich) ). \n\nThe description or representation of individual and group identity is a central task for psychologists, sociologists and anthropologists and those of other disciplines where \"identity\" needs to be mapped and defined. How should one (one)  describe the identity of another (another) , in ways which encompass both their (another)  idiosyncratic qualities and their (another)  group memberships or identifications, both of which can shift according to circumstance? Following on from the work of Kelly (Kelly) , Erikson (Erikson) , Tajfel and others Weinreich (Weinreich) 's Identity Structure Analysis (ISA (Identity Structure Analysis (ISA) ), is \"a structural representation of the individual's existential experience, in which the relationships between self and other agents are organised in relatively stable structures over time \u2026 with the emphasis on the socio-cultural milieu in which self relates to other agents and institutions\" (Weinreich (Weinreich)  and Saunderson (Saunderson) , (eds) 2003 (2003) , p1).
